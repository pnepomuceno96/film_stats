# film_stats
Creates a report of my personal movie viewing and statistics.

## Description
The report is created via a Python script to convert CSV file in to an SQL table. This is done using diary.csv, which is downloaded from my account on letterboxd.com. Once the SQL table is created, the data can be manipulated and sorted to view certain statistics.

## Roadmap
In the long term, I intend to hopefully add more detailed data to each film via SQL or the original CSV file, such as cast, genres, MPAA rating, and possibly even tags that describe the film.
